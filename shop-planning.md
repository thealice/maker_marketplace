Your models must:

   - [x] Include at least one has_many (shop has_many items), at least one belongs_to (item belongs to shop), and at least two has_many :through relationships (1. Category has many items, through item_categories, 2. User has many items through shops)

   - [x] Include a many-to-many relationship implemented with has_many :through associations. The join table must include a user-submittable attribute â€” that is to say, some attribute other than its foreign keys that can be submitted by the app's user (Shops)
    
   - [x] Include reasonable validations for the simple attributes. You don't need to add every possible validation or duplicates, such as presence and a minimum length, but the models should defend against invalid data. (user attributes are validated, email needs to have @, password must be at least 6 characters, Shops validate presence of :name, uniqueness: true, can only add items to a shop if they have a name, Category validates presence of name)

   - [x] Include at least one class level ActiveRecord scope method. a. Your scope method must be chainable, meaning that you must use ActiveRecord Query methods within it (such as .where and .order) rather than native ruby methods (such as #find_all or #sort).
   Category.with_items_alph

Your application must:

   - [x] provide standard user authentication, including signup, login, logout, and passwords.

   - [] allow login from some other service. Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Github, etc...

   - [x] make use of a nested resource with the appropriate RESTful URLs.

   - [x] include a nested new route with form that relates to the parent resource (shops/1/items/new)

   - [x] include a nested index or show route (shops/1/items/4)

Your forms should correctly display validation errors.

    - [x] Your fields should be enclosed within a fields_with_errors class

    - [x] Error messages describing the validation failures must be present within the view.

Your application must be, within reason, a DRY (Do-Not-Repeat-Yourself) rails app.

   - [] Logic present in your controllers should be encapsulated as methods in your models.

   - [] Your views should use helper methods and partials when appropriate.

   - [] Follow patterns in the Rails Style Guide and the Ruby Style Guide.


models: User (with three roles?: Admin, maker, buyer), Shop, Item, CAtegory, ItemCategory, Comment?, Order??, Trade?

you can generate controllers with this command but will also have to edit the routes.rb file if you want to override the defaults
rails generate devise:controllers users

rails generate devise:views users
